His heart is at his mule train

You´re better of without him

[Verse 1]

E                      E                  F#m B   F#m B
There's talk on the street, it sounds so familiar;
A          B                      E         E
great expectations, ev'rybody's watchin' you.
E            E                   F#m  B    F#m7 B
People you meet they all seem to know you,
A           B                               E              G#sus4 G#7
even your old friends treat you like you're somethin' new.


[Chorus]

C#m           F#
Johnny come lately,
C#m             F#
the new kid in town.
C#m        F#
Ev'rybody loves you,
F#m                B7
so don't let them down.


[Verse 2]

E                E                F#m     B     F#m B
You look in her eyes, the music begins to play,
A          B                    E     E
hopeless romantics, here we go again.
E             E                             F#m   B    F#m7 B
But after a while you're lookin' the other way,
			A        B                E     G#sus4 G#7
it's those restless hearts that never mend.


[Chorus]

C#m           F#
Johnny come lately,
C#m             F#
the new kid in town.
C#m             F#
Will she still love you
F#m7             B7
when you're not around?


[Bridge]

E   E   B   B   A   B   E   A E F#m E

B7                B7                   E         E
There's so many things you should have told her,
B7               B7                    C#m
but night after night you're willing to hold her,
		F#7       Am7           Am7/D   D
just hold her, tears on your shoul - der.


[Verse 3]

G                   G                       Am7  D    Am7 D
There's talk on the street, it's there to remind you.
C              D             G          G
Doesn't really matter which side you're on.
G               G                        Am7  D    D7
You're walkin' away and they're talkin' behind you,
			C                     D                   G     B7
they will never forget you 'til somebody new comes along.


[Chorus]

Em7                A
Where've you been lately?
Em7                   A
There's a new kid in town.
Em7        A
Ev'rybody loves him (don't they?)
Am7              B7                   E      G#m7   A
Now he's holdin' her and you're still around.


[Outro]

B7                   E     G#m7   A
There's a new kid in town,
B7                      E     G#m7   A   Am7   E
just another new kid in town.
E                             C#m             C#m   E
Ev'rybody's talkin' 'bout the new kid in town.
E                             C#m             C#m
Ev'rybody's talkin' 'bout the new kid in town.

			My eyes seek reality
			My fingers seek my veins
			There's a dog at your back step
			He must come in from the rain

			So low the sky is all I see
			All I want from you is forgive me
			So you bring this poor dog in from the rain
			Though he just wants right back out again
			
			And I cry, to the alley way
			Confess all to the rain
			But I lie, lie straight to the mirror
			The one I've broken, to match my face
			
			The trash fire is warm
			But nowhere safe from the storm
			And I can't bare to see
			What I've let me be
			So wicked and worn
			So as I write to you
			Of what is done and to do
			Maybe you'll understand

`When I was young I was the nicest guy I knew
I thought I was the chosen one
But time went by and I found out a thing or two
My shine wore off as time wore on

I thought that I was living out the perfect life
But in the lonely hours when the truth begins to bite
I thought about the times when I turned my back & stalled
I ain\'t no nice guy after all

When I was young I was the only game in town
I thought I had it down for sure,
But time went by and I was lost in what I found
The reasons blurred, the way unsure

I thought that I was living life the only way
But as I saw that life was more than day to day
I turned around, I read the writing on the wall
I ain\'t no nice guy after all
I ain\'t no nice guy after all

In all the years you spend between your birth and death
You find there\'s lots of times you should have saved your breath
It comes as quite a shock when that trip leads to fall`		})

`
Oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son?
Oh, where have you been, my darling young one?
I\'ve stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains
I\'ve walked and I\'ve crawled on six crooked highways
I\'ve stepped in the middle of seven sad forests
I\'ve been out in front of a dozen dead oceans
I\'ve been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard
And it\'s a hard, and it\'s a hard, it\'s a hard, and it\'s a hard
And it\'s a hard rain\'s a-gonna fall
Oh, what did you see, my blue-eyed son?
Oh, what did you see, my darling young one?
I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it
I saw a black branch with blood that kept drippin\'
I saw a room full of men with their hammers a-bleedin\'
I saw a white ladder all covered with water
I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken
I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children
And it\'s a hard, and it\'s a hard, it\'s a hard, it\'s a hard
And it\'s a hard rain\'s a-gonna fall
And what did you hear, my blue-eyed son?
And what did you hear, my darling young one?
I heard the sound of a thunder, it roared out a warnin\'
Heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world
Heard one person starve, I heard many people laughin\'
Heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter
Heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley
And it\'s a hard, and it\'s a hard, it\'s a hard, it\'s a hard
And it\'s a hard rain\'s a-gonna fall
Oh, who did you meet, my blue-eyed son?
Who did you meet, my darling young one?
I met a young child beside a dead pony
I met a white man who walked a black dog
I met a young woman whose body was burning
I met a young girl, she gave me a rainbow
I met one man who was wounded in love
I met another man who was wounded with hatred
And it\'s a hard, it\'s a hard, it\'s a hard, it\'s a hard
It\'s a hard rain\'s a-gonna fall
Oh, what\'ll you do now, my blue-eyed son?
Oh, what\'ll you do now, my darling young one?
I\'m a-goin\' back out \'fore the rain starts a-fallin\'
I\'ll walk to the depths of the deepest black forest
Where the people are many and their hands are all empty
Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters
Where the home in the valley meets the damp dirty prison
Where the executioner\'s face is always well-hidden
Where hunger is ugly, where souls are forgotten
Where black is the color, where none is the number
And I\'ll tell it and think it and speak it and breathe it
And reflect it from the mountain so all souls can see it
Then I\'ll stand on the ocean until I start sinkin\'
But I\'ll know my song well before I start singin\'
And it\'s a hard, it\'s a hard, it\'s a hard, it\'s a hard
It\'s a hard rain\'s a-gonna fall`		})

`Hey, Mr Tambourine Man, play a song for me
I\'m not sleepy and there is no place I\'m going to
Hey, Mr Tambourine Man, play a song for me
In the jingle jangle morning, I\'ll come following you
Though I know that evening\'s empire
Has returned into sand
Vanished from my hand
Left me blindly here to stand but still not sleeping
My weariness amazes me
I\'m branded on my feet
I have no one to meet
And the ancient empty street\'s too dead for dreaming
Hey, Mr Tambourine Man, play a song for me
I\'m not sleepy and there is no place I\'m going to
Hey, Mr Tambourine Man, play a song for me
In the jingle jangle morning, I\'ll come following you
Take me on a trip upon your magic swirling ship
My senses have been stripped, my hands can\'t feel to grip
My toes too numb to step, wait only for my boot heels
To be wandering
I\'m ready to go anywhere, I\'m ready for to fade
Into my own parade
Cast your dancing spell my way
I promise to go under it
Hey, Mr Tambourine Man, play a song for me
I\'m not sleepy and there is no place I\'m going to
Hey, Mr Tambourine Man, play a song for me
In the jingle jangle morning, I\'ll come following you
Though you might hear laughing, spinning
Swinging madly across the sun
It\'s not aimed at anyone, it\'s just escaping on the run
And but for the sky, there are no fences facing
And if you hear vague traces of skipping reels of rhyme
To your tambourine in time, it\'s just a ragged clown behind
I wouldn\'t pay it any mind, it\'s just a shadow
You\'re seeing that he\'s chasing
Hey, Mr Tambourine Man, play a song for me
I\'m not sleepy and there is no place I\'m going to
Hey, Mr Tambourine Man, play a song for me
In the jingle jangle morning, I\'ll come following you
Then take me disappearing through the smoke rings of my mind
Down the foggy ruins of time, far past the frozen leaves
The haunted, frightened trees, out to the windy beach
Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow
Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free
Silhouetted by the sea, circled by the circus sands
With all memory and fate driven deep beneath the waves
Let me forget about today until tomorrow
Hey, Mr Tambourine Man, play a song for me
I\'m not sleepy and there is no place I\'m going to
Hey, Mr Tambourine Man, play a song for me
In the jingle jangle morning, I\'ll come following you`		})

D                G               A
I\'m not sleepy and there is no place I\'m going to.
G        A               D               G
Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
D             G                 A         D
In the jingle jangle morning I\'ll come following you.  
[Verse]
G                           A          D             G
Though I know that evenings empire has returned into sand,
D                G
Vanished from my hand,
D               G                   A
Left me blindly here to stand but still not sleeping.
G          A             D             G
My weariness amazes me, I\'m branded on my feet,
D              G
I have no one to meet
D             G                     A
And the ancient empty street\'s too dead for dreaming.
[Chorus]
G        A               D               G
Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
D                G               A
I\'m not sleepy and there is no place I\'m going to.
G        A               D               G
Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
D             G                 A         D
In the jingle jangle morning I\'ll come following you.
[Verse]
G            A              D              G
Take me on a trip upon your magic swirling ship,
D                G            D                   G
My senses have been stripped, my hands can\'t feel to grip,
D                G          D           G
My toes too numb to step, wait only for my boot heels
A
To be wandering.
G           A             D            G
I\'m ready to go anywhere, I\'m ready for to fade
D           G               D                G
Into my own parade, cast your dancing spell my way,
        A
I promise to go under it.
[Chorus]
G        A               D               G
Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
D                G               A
I\'m not sleepy and there is no place I\'m going to.
G        A               D               G
Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
D             G                 A         D
In the jingle jangle morning I\'ll come following you.
[Verse]
G                               A                  D                G
Though you might hear laughing, spinning, swinging madly across the sun,
 D           G                D             G
It\'s not aimed at anyone, it\'s just escaping on the run
D                 G             A
And but for the sky there are no fences facing.
G                 A         D                 G
And if you hear vague traces of skipping reels of rhyme
D             G                 D              G
To your tambourine in time, it\'s just a ragged clown behind,
   D          G                 D
I wouldn\'t pay it any mind, it\'s just a shadow you\'re
G                A
Seeing that he\'s chasing.
[Chorus]
G        A               D               G
Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
D                G               A
I\'m not sleepy and there is no place I\'m going to.
G        A               D               G
Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
D             G                 A         D
In the jingle jangle morning I\'ll come following you.
[Bridge]
G            A                   D                 G
Then take me disappearing through the smoke rings of my mind,
 D              G         D               G
Down the foggy ruins of time, far past the frozen leaves,
D                   G          D            G
The haunted, frightened trees, out to the windy beach,
D                G              A
Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow.
G                 A                D               G
Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free,
D              G            D             G
Silhouetted by the sea, circled by the circus sands,
 D          G           D                G
With all memory and fate driven deep beneath the waves,
  D         G             A
Let me forget about today until tomorrow.
[Chorus]
G        A               D               G
Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
D                G               A
I\'m not sleepy and there is no place I\'m going to.
G        A               D               G
Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
D             G                 A         D
In the jingle jangle morning I\'ll come following you.`		})

G             Em         C        G
Come gather \'round people wherever you roam
G            Am      C              D
And admit that the waters around you have grown
G            Em             C               G
And accept it that soon you\'ll be drenched to the bone

If your time to you is worth savin\'
 D            D7                 D6          D
Then you better start swimmin\' or you\'ll sink like a stone,

For the times, they are a-changin\'
[Verse 2]
G           Em                C              G
Come writers and critics who prophesize with your pen
G              Am              C           D
And keep your eyes wide the chance won\'t come again

And don\'t speak too soon for the wheel\'s still in spin

And there\'s no tellin\' who that it\'s namin\'

Come senators, congressmen please heed the call

Don\'t stand in the doorway, don\'t block up the hall

Travelling in a fried-out kombi

On a hippy trail, head full of zombie

I met a strange lady, she made me nervous

I gazed a gazely stare

A       F#m
Almost heaven, West Virginia,
E                     D          A
Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River.
A                  F#m
Life is old there, older than the trees,

Younger than the mountains, blowin\' like a breeze

Miner\'s lady, stranger to blue water.

Dark and dusty, painted on the sky,

Misty taste of moonshine, teardrop in my eye.

Am                         E7
On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair
G                      D
Warm smell of colitas rising up through the air
F                          C
Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light
Dm
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
E
I had to stop for the night
Am                               E7
There she stood in the doorway; I heard the mission bell
G
And I was thinking to myself
      D
This could be heaven or this could be hell
F                          C
Then she lit up a candle, and she showed me the way
Dm
There were voices down the corridor,
E
I thought I heard them say...
[Chorus]
F                          C
Welcome to the Hotel California.
E7                                          Am
Such a lovely place, (such a lovely place), such a lovely face
F                               C
Plenty of room at the Hotel California
Dm                                       E
Any time of year, (any time of year) You can find it here
[Verse]
Am                            E7
Her mind is Tiffany-twisted, She got the Mercedes bends
G                                    D
She got a lot of pretty pretty boys   she calls friends
F                                   C
How they danced in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat
Dm                       E
Some dance to remember, some dance to forget
Am                           E7
So I called up the captain; Please bring me my wine (he said)
G                                     D
We haven\'t had that spirit here since 1969
F                                         C
and still those voices are calling from far away
Dm
Wake you up in the middle of the night 
E
Just to hear them say...
[Chorus]
F                         C
Welcome to the Hotel California.
E7                                          Am
Such a lovely place, (such a lovely place), such a lovely face
F                             C
They\'re livin\' it up at the Hotel California
Dm                                               E
What a nice surprise, (what a nice surprise) Bring your alibis
[Verse]
Am                        E7
Mirrors on the ceiling; the pink champagne on ice (and she said)
G                                D
We are all just prisoners here, of our own device
F                              C
and in the master\'s chambers, they gathered for the feast
Dm
They stab it with their steely knives but they
E
just can\'t kill the beast
Am                             E7
Last thing I remember, I was running for the door
G                                       D
I had to find the passage back to the place I was before
F                                   C
"Relax" said the night man; we are programmed to receive
Dm
You can check out any time you like
E
But you can never leave...

`    E                            A/E             E
On a warm summer\'s evenin\' on a train bound for nowhere,
E                                                    B7
I met up with the gambler; we were both too tired to sleep.
E                                A/E           E
So we took turns a starin\' out the window at the darkness
                  B7              E
\'til boredom overtook us, and he began to speak.
[Verse 2]
(Bass in)
 E                             A/E              E
He said, "Son, I\'ve made a life out of readin\' people\'s faces,
                                                     B7
and knowin\' what their cards were by the way they held their eyes.
E                               A/E               E
And if you don\'t mind my sayin\', I can see you\'re out of aces.
A/E           E            B7            E
For a taste of your whiskey I\'ll give you some advice."
Verse 3: (strumming starts)
E                           A                  E
So I handed him my bottle and he drank down my last swallow.
                                      B7
Then he bummed a cigarette and asked me for a light.
E                                A                 E
And the night got deathly quiet, and his face lost all expression.
         A               E                  B7               E
Said, "If you\'re gonna play the game, boy, ya gotta learn to play it right.
[Chorus]
   E                     A             E
You got to know when to hold \'em, know when to fold \'em,
A            E                          B7
know when to walk away and know when to run.
  E     A    E                 A              E
You never count your money when you\'re sittin\' at the table.
    E    A          E        B7                E
There\'ll be time enough for countin\' when the dealin\'s done.
[Verse 4]
(Key change)
F                            Bb             F
Ev\'ry gambler knows that the secret to survivin\'
                                          C
is knowin\' what to throw away and knowing what to keep.
F                         Bb              F
\'Cause ev\'ry hand\'s a winner and ev\'ry hand\'s a loser,
Bb                 F              C           F
and the best that you can hope for is to die in your sleep."
[Verse 5]
F                               Bb                       F
And when he\'d finished speakin\', he turned back towards the window,
                                   C7
crushed out his cigarette and faded off to sleep.
F                             Bb                 F
And somewhere in the darkness the gambler, he broke even.
Bb            F                C7               F
But in his final words I found an ace that I could keep.
[Chorus]
   F                     Bb             F
You got to know when to hold \'em, know when to fold \'em,

I\'ve been to Hollywood,   I\'ve been to Redwood

I\'ve crossed the ocean for a heart of gold

I\'ve been in my mind,   it\'s such a fine line

`[Intro]
Bm 
[Verse 1] 
(Willie Nelson)
Bm       A                     G                Bm 
I was a highwayman, along the coach roads I did ride
A          G      D     A
Sword and pistol by my side
Em      Bm                  A              G
Many a young maid lost her baubles to my trade
Em     Bm                A                G
Many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade
Bm            A                G        A     D
The bastards hung me in the spring of twenty five
Bm         G     A
But I am still alive
[Verse 2]
(Kris Kristofferson)
Bm       A             G            Bm 
I was a sailor, I was born upon the tide
A         G     D    A
With the sea I did abide
Em            Bm               A           G
I sailed a schooner round the horn to Mexico
Em      Bm                   A               G
I went aloft and furled the main sail in a blow
Bm            A                    G       A      D
And when the yards broke off they say that I got killed
Bm        G       A
But I am living still
[Verse 3]
(Waylon Jennings)
Bm       A                     G             Bm
I was a dam builder, across a river deep and wide
A                G     D      A
Where steel and water did collide
Em              Bm             A        G
A place called Boulder on the wild Colorado
Em            Bm             A              G
I slipped and fell into the wet concrete below
Bm           A               G          A       D
They buried me in that gray tomb that knows no sound
Bm         G     A
But I am still around
[Bridge]
(All)
         D           D/C#        Bm          A           G      D/F#
I\'ll always be around, and around, and around, and around, and around...
Em G A D
[Verse 4]
(Johnny Cash)
Bm           A                 G          Bm 
I\'ll fly a starship across the universe divide
A           G        D      A
And when I reach the other side
Em           Bm                A          G
I\'ll find a place to rest my spirit if I can
Em         Bm           A           G
Perhaps I may become a highwayman again
Bm        A           G       A      D
Or I may simply be a single drop of rain
Bm     G      A
But I will remain
[Outro]
(All)
           D         D/C#        Bm         A          G     D/F#
And I\'ll be back again, and again, and again, and again, and again...

Come sit down beside me,  my only son.

And you can do this, oh baby,  if you try.

All that I want for you my son, is to be satisfied.

Follow your heart,  and nothing else.

And the only time, he\'s satisfied,

[Verse 1]
C           D             G        Em
He is five feet two, and he\'s six feet four,
C          D                G     
he fights with missiles and with spears. 
C            D              G       Em
He is all of thirty-one, and he\'s only seventeen.
   C                    Am       D
\'s been a soldier for thousand years.
[Verse 2]
C           D         G         Em
He\'s a Catholic, a Hindu, an atheist,a Chein, 
C               D             G
a Buddhist and a Baptist and a Jew. 
C                  D            G                Em
And he knows,he shouldn\'t kill, and he knows he always will,
     C                    Am        D
kill you for me my friend and and me for you.
[Verse 3]
  C            D            G             Em
And he\'s fighting for Canada, he\'s fighting for France.
C               D   G
He\'s fighting for the U.S.A., 
 C                D                   G            Em
and he\'s fighting for the Russians, and he\'s fighting for Japan,
C               Am               D
and he thinks we put an end to war this way.
[Verse 4]
 C               D            G                Em
And he\'s fighting for democracy, he\'s fighting for the Reds.
C                  D         G
He says it\'s for the peace of all.
 C               D             G                  Em 
He\'s the one who must decide, who\'s to live and who\'s to die,
C             Am              D
and he never sees the writing on the wall.
[Verse 5]
C                  D                 G           Em
But without him, how would Hitler have condemned him at Dachau,
C           D                 G
without him Caesar would have stood alone.
  C                D         G              Em
He\'s the one who gives his body as a weapon of the war,
C                Am                D        
and without him all this killing can\'t go on. 
[Verse 6]   
  C             D            G            Em
He\'s the universal soldier and he really is to blame,
C              D            G
his orders come from far away, no more.
         C                  D             
They come from here and there, and you and me, 
G                  Em
and brothers, can\'t you see, 
 C            Am               D
this is not the way we put an end to war.`		})

Dm
[Verse 1]
Dm
My lover comes to me with a rose on her bosom
F              C/E        Am                Dm
The moon\'s dancin\' purple all through her black hair
Dm
And a lady\'s in waiting she\'ll stand \'neath my window
F             C/E         Am            Dm
And the sun will rise soon on the false and the fair
C     Am         Dm
Sing a-too a-loor-a-lie-o
[Verse 2]
Dm
She tells me she comes from my mother the mountain
F             C/E             Am          Dm
Her skin fits her tightly and her lips do not lie
Dm
She silently slips from her throat a medallion
F          C/E          Am          Dm
Slowly she twirls it in front of my eyes
C     Am         Dm
Sing a-too a-loor-a-lie-o
[Verse 3]
Dm
I watch her, I love her, I long for to touch her
F           C/E        Am         Dm
The satin she\'s wearin\' is shimmering blue
Dm
Outside my window her ladies are sleeping
F            C/E          Am         Dm
My dog\'s a-gone hunting, the howling is through
C     Am         Dm
Sing a-too a-loor-a-lie-o
[Verse 4]
Dm
So I reach for her hand and her eyes turn to poison
F             C/E               Am             Dm
And her hair turns to splinters and her flesh turns to brine
Dm
She leaps \'cross the room, she stands in the window
F               C/E             Am        Dm
And screams that my first-born will surely be blind
C     Am         Dm
Sing a-too a-loor-a-lie-o
[Verse 5]
 Dm
Then she throws herself out to the black of the nightfall
F          C/E           Am          Dm
She\'s parted her lips, but she makes not a sound
Dm
I fly down the stairway and I run to the garden
F           C/E          Am          Dm
No trace of my true love is there to be found
C     Am         Dm
Sing a-too a-loor-a-lie-o
[Verse 6]
Dm
So walk these hills lightly and watch who you\'re lovin\'
F          C/E         Am              Dm
By mother the mountain, I swear that it\'s true
Dm
And love not a woman with hair black as midnight
F             C/E       Am         Dm
And a dress made of satin all shimmering blue
C     Am         Dm
Sing a-too a-loor-a-lie-o
[Verse 7]
Dm
Oh my lover comes to me with a rose on her bosom
F              C/E        Am                Dm
The moon\'s dancing purple all through her black hair
Dm
And a lady\'s in waiting, she\'ll stand \'neath my window
F             C/E         Am            Dm
And the sun will rise soon on the false and the fair`		})

Dm                       C         Bb         A
And then the man he steps right up to the microphone
Dm              C               Bb        A    (A7)
And says at last just as the time bell ring
F                      C
Goodnight, now it\'s time to go home
Bb                                       Dm     Bb - C
Then he makes it fast with one more thing

We are the Sultans

We are the Sultans of Swing

One day in the year of the fox

Came a time remembered well

When the strong young man

Tolling of the great black bell

One day in the year of the fox when the

Bell began to ring, it meant the

Time had come for the one to go to the

Temple of the King

There in the middle of the circle, he stands
[ch]Am[/ch]
Searching, Seeking,
[ch]G[/ch]         
With just one touch of his trembling hand

The answer will be found

Daylight waits for the oldman\'s screams
[ch]Am[/ch]      
Heaven, help me,
[ch]G[/ch]                   [ch]Dm[/ch]
Just like a rush of thousand wings

It shines upon the One
[ch]F[/ch]       [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]Am[/ch]     
And the day has just begun

Singing songs about the south land

Em                 D
If the stars, fall down on me,
Am             Em
And the sun, refused to shine
Em                       D
Then may the shackles be undone,
Am                    Em
May all the old words cease to rhyme
Em                 D
If the sky, turned into stone,
Am                Em
It would matter not at all
Em                      D
For there is no heaven, in the sky,
Am                   
Hell does not wait, for our downfall
[Pre-Chorus]
C                  G
Let the voice of reason shine,
Am                   Em
Let the pious vanish, for all time,
C                     G
God\'s face is hidden, all unseen,
Am                    Em
You can\'t ask him what it all means
[Chorus]
C                G
He was never on your side,
Am               Em
God was never on your side,

Let right or wrong alone decide
Am                                    
God was never on your side.
[Verse 2]
Em                D
See ten thousand ministries,
Am               Em
See the holy righteous dogs
Em                          D                       
They claim to heal, but all they do is steal,
Am                Em
Abuse your faith, cheat, and rob
Em                D          
If God is wise, why is he still,
Am                         Em
When these false prophets, call him friend
Em                D
Why is he silent, is he blind?
Am
Are we abandoned, in the end?
[Pre-Chorus]

Let the sword of reason shine,
Am                Em
Let us be free of prayer and shrine

God\'s face is hidden, turned away,

He never has a word to say

He was never on your side,

God was never on your side

God was never on your side

No, No, No.

`Father time, I\'m running late
I\'m winding down, I\'m growing tired
Seconds drift into the night
The clock just ticks \'til my time expires
You were once my friend
Now I know I can\'t tie your hands
The days I saved I couldn\'t spend
They fell like sand through the hourglass
No time to lose, no time to choose
Time taking time, it\'s taken mine
Scenes of my life seem so unkind
Time chasing time creeps up behind
I can\'t run forever and time waits for no one
Not even me
An enemy I can\'t defend
My final place, a deadly end
Life is just a speck in space
Dreams of an eternal resting place
I can\'t get any younger
Time has brutal hunger
Time taking time, it\'s taken mine
Scenes of my life seem so unkind
Time chasing time creeps up behind
I can\'t run forever and time waits for no one, waits for no one
Not even me...`		})

`[Intro]
Am
This is the greatest and best song in the world...   Tribute.
[Verse]
Am
Long time ago me and my brother Kyle here,
Am
We was hitchhikin\' down a long and lonesome road.
Am
All of a sudden, there shined a shiny demon...
Am
In the middle of the road.
Am
And he said:
Play the A string but palm mute it.
"Play the best song in the world, or I\'ll eat your souls."
Am
Well me and Kyle, we looked at each other,
Am
And we each said...   "Okay"
Am                                 G
And we played the first thing that came to our heads,
F
Just so happened to be,
Am                   G             F
The Best Song in the World, it was The Best Song in the World.
[Chorus]
D                          F
Look into my eyes and it\'s easy to see
C                     G
One and one make two, two and one make three,
F
It was destiny.
D                           F
Once every hundred-thousand years or so,
 C                      G
When the sun doth shine and the moon doth glow
 F
And the grass don\'t grow...
[Verse]
Am
Needless to say, the beast was stunned.
Am
Whip-crack went his schwumpy tail,
Am
And the beast was done.
Am
He asked us: "Be you angels?"
Am
And we said, "Nay. We are but men!"
ROCK!
D     F     C       G
Ahhh, ahhh, ahhh-ah-ah,
F
Ohhh, whoah, ah-whoah-oh!
[Chorus]
Am               G                   F
This is not The Greatest Song in the World.
Am                 G        F
No, this is just a tribute.
Am                    G                    F
Couldn\'t remember The Greatest Song in the World.
Am            G        F
No, this is a tribute, oh.
Am G               D           F
To The Greatest Song in the World, All right!
Am G                   D           F
It was The Greatest Song in the World, All right!
Am         G
It was the best muthafuckin\' song
D                        F
The greatest song in the world.
[Solo:] Am - G - D - F   (x2)
Am               G
And the peculiar thing is this my friends:
D                        F
The song we sang on that fateful night,
Am                       G                  D      F
It didn\'t actually sound anything like this song.
[Verse]
       Am           G           D      F
This is just a tribute! You gotta\' believe me!
            Am      G                 D      F
And I wish you were there! Just a matter of opinion.
  Am        G
Ah, fuck! Good God, God lovin\',
D                    F
So surprised to find you can\'t stop it.
Am   G   D   F
[Outro]
E     F     G         E     F

`[Verse 1]
   Am                             G
Casey joins the hollow sound of silent people walking down
      F                              E
The stairway to the subway in the shadows down below
  Am                                 G
Following their footsteps through the neon darkened corridors
    F                         E
Of silent desperation,never speaking to a soul
[Verse 2]
     F                                C
The poison air he\'s breathing has a dirty smell of dying
            Dm                                E
Cause it\'s never seen the sunshine and it\'s never felt the rain
     Am                         G
But Casey minds the arrows and ignores the fatal echoes
         F                                 E              Am
Of the clicking of the turnstile and the rattle of his chains
[Bridge 1]
  C                                                    G
"Oh",she said "Casey it\'s been so long since i\'ve seen you"
                                              C
"Here",she said "Just a kiss to make a body smile"
                                                          G
"See",she said "I\'ve put on new stockings just to please you"
                                           C
"Lord" she said "Casey can you only stay awhile"
[Verse 3]
  Am                              G
Casey leaves the underground and stops inside the golden crown
      F                              E
For something wet to wipe away the chill that\'s on his bones
  Am                           G
Seeing his reflection in the lives of all the lonely men
      F                             E
Who reach for anything they can to keep from going home
[Verse 4]
  F                            C
Standing in the corner,Casey drinks his pint of bitter
       Dm                             E
Never glancing in the mirror at the people passing by
          Am                             G
Then he stumbles as he\'s leaving and he wonders if the reason
        F                               E                 Am
Is the beer that\'s in his belly or the tear that\'s in his eye
[Bridge 2]
  C                                                  G
"Oh",she said "I suppose that you seldom think about me"
                                                  C
"Now",she said "Now that you\'ve a family of your own"
                                                         G
"Still",she said "It\'s so blessed and good to feel your body"

[Verse 1]
Am                          Am
She came to me one morning, one lonely Sunday morning
G                        Am
Her long hair flowing in the midwinter wind
Am                               Am
I know not how she found me for in darkness I was walking
G                             Am
And destruction lay around me from a fight I could not win
[Chorus]
| Am             | G           Am |
Ah...  ahah.. ahahah...  ahahah

[Verse 2]
Am                           Am
She asked me name my foe then, I said the need within some men
G                                     Am
To fight and kill their brothers without thought of love or God
Am                           Am
And I begged her give me horses to trample down my enemies
G                         Am
So eager was my passion to devour this waste of life
[Chorus]
| Am             | G           Am |
Ah...  ahah.. ahahah...  ahahah
| Am          G  |       Am |
Ah...  ahahah...  ahahah
[Verse 3]
Am                               Am
But she would not think of battle that reduces men to animals
G                       Am
So easy to begin and yet impossible to end
Am                              Am
For she\'s the mother of our men who counselled me so wisely then
G                                Am
I feared to walk alone again and asked if she would stay
[Chorus]
| Am             | G           Am |
Ah...  ahah.. ahahah...  ahahah
| Am          G   |      Am |
Ah...  ahahah...  ahahah
[Verse 4]
Am                               Am
Oh, lady lend your hand outright and let me rest here at your side
G                                     Am
Have faith and trust in peace she said and filled my heart with life
Am                              Am
There is no strength in numbers, have no such misconception
G                             Am
But when you need me be assured I won\'t be far away
[Chorus]

Ah...  ahah.. ahahah...  ahahah

Ah...  ahahah...  ahahah
[Verse 5]
Am                               Am
Thus having spoke she turned away and though I found no words to say
G                                Am
I stood and watched until I saw her black coat disappear
Am                      Am
My labour is no easier but now I know I\'m not alone
G                                 Am
I find new heart each time I think upon that windy day
Am                                Am
And if one day she comes to you drink deeply from her words so wise
G                                  Am
Take courage from her as your prize and say hello from me
[Chorus]
| Am             | G           Am |
Ah...  ahah.. ahahah...  ahahah

[Verse]
Gm
I have often told you stories
F
About the way
Gm
I lived the life of a drifter
Dm
waiting for the day
  Gm
When I\'d take your hand and sing you songs
F
Then maybe you would say
Gm
Come lay with me and love me
Dm                     
And I would surely stay
[Chorus]
Bb       C                Gm   
But I feel I\'m growing older
Eb          F                Bb
And the songs that I have sung
D            Gm
Echo in the distance
   F
Like the sound
Bb              Eb  
Of a windmill going round
Cm                Dm
Guess I\'ll always be
      Gm
A soldier of fortune.

Gm   C   Gm   C  
Gm   Bb   C   Gm
[Verse]
Gm 
Many times I\'ve been a traveller
F
I looked for something new
    Gm   
In days of old when nights were cold
Dm
I wandered without you
Gm
But those days I thought my eyes
F
Had seen you standing near
Gm
Though blindness is confusing
Dm  
It shows that you\'re not here.
[Chorus]
Bb       C                Gm   
But I feel I\'m growing older
Eb          F                Bb

Fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way

And you run and you run to catch up with the Sun, but it\'s sinking;
E                                     F#m
Racing around to come up behind you again.

The Sun is the same in a relative way, but you\'re older,
E                                         F#m
shorter of breath, and one day closer to death.

Plans that either come to naught, or half a page of scribbled lines.

Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way.

D                C                 G                         D

I can see clearly now the rain is gone

Hello,
         A
is there anybody in there? 
G              Em
Just nod if you can hear me;
 Bm
is there anyone home? 
Come on, now,
      A
I hear you\'re feeling down.
G               Em
Well, I can ease your pain;
Bm
get you on your feet again.
Relax,
         A
I need some information first.
G              Em
Just the basic facts:
Bm
can you show me where it hurts? 
D                           A
There is no pain, you are receding.
D                              A
A distant ships smoke on the horizon.
C                              G
You are only coming through in waves.
C                                      G
Your lips move but I can\'t hear what you re saying.
D                     A
When I was a child I had a fever.
D                           A
My hands felt just like two balloons.
C                            G
Now I got that feeling once again;
             C
I can\'t explain, you would not understand.
          G
This is not how I am.
A C       G                 D
I  have become, comfortably numb.
D A D A C G C G
A C       G                 D
I  have become, comfortably numb.
Bm
Ok, (ok)
      A
just a little pinprick. 
              G      Em
There\'ll be no more --aaaaaahhhhh!
    Bm
But you may feel a little sick.
Can you stand up? 
          A
I do believe it\'s working good.
         G              Em
That\'ll keep you going for the show.
     Bm
Come on it\'s time to go.
D                           A
There is no pain, you are receding.
D                               A
A distant ship\'s smoke on the horizon.
C                              G
You are only coming through in waves.
C                                      G
Your lips move but I can\'t hear what you\'re saying.
D                        A
When I was a child I caught a fleeting glimpse,
D                       A
out of the corner of my eye.
C                         G
I turned to look but it was gone.
               C
I cannot put my finger on it now.
                G
The child is grown, the dream is gone.
A C       G                 D
I  have become, comfortably numb.`		})

D
She\'s got a smile that it seems to me
C
Reminds me of childhood memories
G
Where everything
                        D
Was as fresh as a bright blue sky
D
Now and then when I see her face

She takes me away to that special place

And if I stared to long

I\'d probably break down and cry

Her hair reminds me of a warm safe place

Where as a child I\'d hide

And pray for the thunder and rain

To quietly pass me by

I\'m sitting in the railway station.
Amaj7                  A7    F#
Got a ticket for my destination, mmmm
Bm                               G
On a tour of one-night stands my suitcase and guitar in hand.
A                                  E7               A
And ev\'ry stop is neatly planned for a poet and one-man band.
[Chorus]
 D            A
Homeward bound,  wish I was,
 D
Homeward bound,
A             Asus4
Home where my thought\'s escaping
A             Asus4
Home where my music\'s playing,
A             Asus4
Home where my love lays waiting
E           A
Silently for me.
[Verse]
A
Ev\'ry day\'s an endless stream
Amaj7               A7      F#
Of cigarettes and magazines, mmmm
Bm                                  G
And each town looks the same to me, the movies and the factories
A                             E7                       A
And ev\'ry stranger\'s face I see reminds me that I long to be,
[Chorus]
 D            A
Homeward bound,  wish I was,
 D
Homeward bound,
A             Asus4
Home where my thought\'s escaping
A             Asus4
Home where my music\'s playing,
A             Asus4
Home where my love lays waiting
E           A
Silently for me.
[Verse]
A
Tonight I\'ll sing my songs again,
Amaj7                 A7     F#
I\'ll play the game and pretend, mmmm
Bm                              G
But all my words come back to me in shades of mediocrity
A                      E7                      A
Like emptiness in harmony I need someone to comfort me.
[Chorus]
 D            A
Homeward bound,  wish I was,
 D
Homeward bound,
A             Asus4
Home where my thought\'s escaping

Home where my music\'s playing,

Home where my love lays waiting
E           A
Silently for me.

Look at your women crying

The billions shift from side to side

And the wars go on with brainwashed pride

For the love of God and our human rights
Em
And all these things are swept aside
G                                   D/F#
By bloody hands time can\'t deny

And are washed away by your genocide

And in my first memories they shot Kennedy

I went numb when I learned to see so I never fell for Vietnam

We got the wall of D.C. to remind us all that you can\'t trust freedom

When it\'s not in your hands when everybody\'s fightin\'

For all I\'ve seen has changed my mind

    G                   D                            Em
With no love of God or human rights \'cause all these dreams are swept aside

[Verse]
D                           G7/D
The lunatic is on the grass.
D                           G7/D
The lunatic is on the grass.
D                       E/D
Remembering games and daisy chains and laughs.
A7                                 D    Dsus2
Got to keep the loonies on the path.
D                          G7/D
The lunatic is in the hall.
D                        G7/D
The lunatics are in my hall.
D                              E/D
The paper holds their folded faces to the floor
A7                             D        Dsus2  D7  D9
And every day the paper boy brings more.
[Chorus]
G                            A
And if the dam breaks open many years too soon
C                                   G
And if there is no room upon the hill
G                                    A7
And if your head explodes with dark forebodings too
C                                   G     Bm7  Em7  A  A7
I\'ll see you on the dark side of the moon.
[Verse]
D                          G7/D
The lunatic is in my head.    (laughter)
D                          G7/D
The lunatic is in my head
D                     E/D
You raise the blade, you make the change
A7                                D     Dsus2
You re-arrange me \'till I\'m sane.
D
You lock the door
E/D
And throw away the key
A7                              D   Dsus2   D7  D9
There\'s someone in my head but it\'s not me.
[Chorus]
G                          A
And if the cloud bursts, thunder in your ear
C                                   G
You shout and no one seems to hear.
                         A           A7        A
And if the band you\'re in starts playing different tunes
C                                   G  Bm7  Em  A7
I\'ll see you on the dark side of the moon.

And when your hand is on your heart

You\'re nearly a good laugh, almost a joker
With your head down the pigbin saying keep on digging

Pig stain on your fat chin
What do you hope to find down in the pig mine
You\'re nearly a laugh, you\'re nearly a laugh

You radiate cold shafts of broken glass

You\'re nearly a good laugh, almost worth a quick grin
You like the feel of steel, you\'re hot stuff with a hat pin
Am7
And good fun with a hand gun
You\'re nearly a laugh, you\'re nearly a laugh

You\'re trying to keep our feeling off the street
Am
You\'re nearly a real treat, all tight lips and cold feet
And do you feel abused

You gotta stem the evil tide and keep it all on the inside

ACOUSTIC SOLO 1

VERSE 1
********
F                          C
I was spending my time in the doldrums
F                            C
I was caught in a cauldron of hate
F                    Am
I felt persecuted and paralyzed
       G                          F
I thought that everything else would just wait
C F
-----------------------
VERSE 2
********
      F                         C
While you are wasting your time on your enemies
F                    C
Engulfed in a fever of spite
F                       Am
Beyond your tunnel vision reality fades
G                F
Like shadows into the night
C F
-----------------------
VERSE 3
********
F                  C
To martyr yourself to caution
F                    C
Is not going to help at all
         F                       Am
Because there\'ll be no safety in numbers
 G                          F
When the right one walks out of the door
C F
-----------------------
BREAK

D  F  Bb  Am  Bb  Dm  F  D

KEY CHANGE
VERSE 4
********
C                         G
Can you see your days blighted by darkness
C                               G
Is it true you beat your fists on the floor
C                      Em
Stuck in a world of isolation
  D                  C
While the ivy grows over the door
D C
-----------------------
VERSE 5
********
C                  G
So I open my door to my enemies
C                           G
And I ask could we wipe the slate clean
 C                 Em
But they tell me please go fuck myself
D                         C
You know you just can\'t win

Fly the wind it will take me

And I didn\'t care           for you
 A                           A7
We would zig-zag our way through the boredom and pain
G          C        D              G
Occasionally glancing up through the rain
Am        F            Am                F  C  C/B Am
Wondering which of the buggers to blame

And watching             for pig on the wing

So I don\'t feel alone or the weight of the stone

Now that I\'ve found somewhere safe to bury my bone

And any fool knows     a dog needs a home

`On the turning away
From the pale and downtrodden
And the words they say
Which we won\'t understand
"Don\'t accept that what\'s happening
Is just a case of others\' suffering
Or you\'ll find that you\'re joining in
The turning away"                               Now the chords.
[Verse 1]
(Em)   (D)     G
It\'s a sin that somehow
    C         Em
Light is changing to shadow
  D    G
And casting its shroud
C
Over all we have known
Em              C          G
Unaware how the ranks have grown
Em             G        C
Driven on by a heart of stone
G                        C   Em
We could find that we\'re all alone
D            G
In the dream of the proud
[Verse 2]
Em     D            G
On the wings of the night
C          Em
As the daytime is stirring
  D         G
Where the speechless unite
C
In a silent accord
G                    C         Em
Using words you will find are strange
G                     Em         C
And mesmerized as they light the flame
G                    C
Feel the new wind of change
Em      D           G
On the wings of the night
[Verse 3]
Em      D       G
No more turning away
 C           Em 
From the weak and the weary
Em      D       G
No more turning away
 C
From the coldness inside
G                    C        Em
Just a world that we all must share
G                       Em        C
It\'s not enough just to stand and stare
G             C                 Em       
Is it only a dream that there\'ll be
D       G
No more turning away?`		})

When I look into your eyes
            C
I can see a love restrained
F                  Dm
But darling when I hold you
                  C
Don\'t you know I feel the same
Dm                   G
Cause nothin\' lasts forever

And we both know hearts can change

And it\'s hard to hold a candle

We\'ve been through this such a long, long time

Just tryin\' to kill the pain, oh yeah
F
But lovers always come and lovers always go
Dm                                    C
And no one\'s really sure who\'s lettin\' go today, walkin\' away
F
If we could take the time to lay it on the line
Dm
I could rest my head
                   C
Just knowin\' that you were mine, all mine
Dm                G
So if you want to love me
           C
Then darlin\' don\'t refrain
Dm                  G
Or I\'ll just end up walkin\'

In the cold November rain

Do you need some time on your own?
F                  G
Do you need some time all alone?
  F                        G
Everybody needs some time on their own
           F                  G
Don\'t you know you need some time all alone
[Bridge]
Em          F               C
I know it\'s hard to keep an open heart
Em        F                   Dm
When even friends seem out to harm you
Em         F            C
But if you could heal a broken heart
Em       F              G
Wouldn\'t time be out to charm you
[Chorus]
F                                G
Sometimes I need some time on my own
    F                  G
Sometimes I need some time all alone
  F                        G
Everybody needs some time on their own
           F                  G
Don\'t you know you need some time all alone
[Verse 3]
F
And when your fears subside
Dm                C
And shadows still remain, oh yeah
F                   Dm
I know that you can love me
                    C
When there\'s no one left to blame
Dm                G
So never mind the darkness
            C
We still can find a way
Dm                  G
Cause nothin\' lasts forever

Then she\'ll be a true love of mine
[Verse 4]
Am                         G         Am
Tell her to reap it with a sickle of leather
                          (War bellows blazing in scarlet battalions)
C          Am        C D      Am
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
                         (Generals order their soldiers to kill)
    Am        C        C G/B Am G
And gather it all in a bunch of heather
               (And to fight for a cause - they\'ve long-ago forgotten)
Am          G                 Am
Then she\'ll be a true love of mine
[Verse 5]
Am               G           Am
Are you going to Scarborough Fair
C          Am        C D      Am
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
  Am     C     C   G/B Am    G
Remember me to one who lives there

She once was a true love of mine`		})

`[Verse 1]
Em                D6/9
On the first part of the journey
Em                D6/9
I was lookin at all the life
    Em                 D6/9
There were plants and birds and rocks and things
    Em                D6/9
There were sand and hills and rings
Em                  D6/9
The first thing I met was a fly with a buzz
 Em           D6/9
and the sky with no clouds
Em                   D6/9
the heat was hot and the ground was dry
 Em              D6/9
but the air was full of sound
[Chorus]
Em9                         Dmaj9
I\'ve been through the desert on a horse with no name
Em9                   Dmaj9
it felt good to be out of the rain
Em9           Dmaj9
in the desert you can remember your name
      Em9                Dmaj9
\'cause there ain\'t no one for to give you no pain

[Verse 2]
Em                D6/9
After two days in the desert sun
Em                D6/9
my skin began to turn red
Em              D6/9
After three days in the desert fun
Em                D6/9
I was looking at a river bed
Em                D6/9
And the story it told of a river that flowed
Em                 D6/9
made me sad to think it was dead
[Chorus]
Em9                         Dmaj9
I\'ve been through the desert on a horse with no name
Em9                   Dmaj9
it felt good to be out of the rain

[Verse 3]
Em                D6/9
After nine days I let the horse run free
    Em                D6/9
\'cause the desert had turned to sea
    Em                  D6/9 
there were plants and birds and rocks and things
     Em                D6/9
there were sand and hills and rings
Em                        D6/9
The ocean is a desert with it\'s life underground
  Em              D6/9
and the perfect disguise above
    Em           D6/9
Under the cities lies a heart made of ground
 Em                 D6/9
but the humans will give no love
[Chorus]
Em9                         Dmaj9
I\'ve been through the desert on a horse with no name
Em9                   Dmaj9

Since you\'ve gone I\'ve been lost without a trace
                              Eb
I dream at night, I can only see your face
                             F
I look around but it\'s you I can\'t replace
                             Eb
I feel so cold and I long for your embrace
                  G
I keep crying baby, baby, please

Oh can\'t you see, you belong to me
          A7                         D
How my poor heart aches, with every step you take
         G                
Every breath you take
       Em
Every move you make
       C
Every bond you break
       D
Every step you take

I\'ll be watching you

Am             Em
I\'m sitting here in a boring room,
Am                        Em
It\'s just another rainy sunday afternoon.
Am              Em
I\'m wasting my time, I got nothing to do.
Am                 Em
I\'m hanging around, I\'m waiting for you,
Dm             Em           Am       [ Em ] ( Am )
But nothing ever happens - and I wonder.

Am             Em 
I\'m driving around in my car,
Am                        Em
I\'m driving too fast, I\'m driving too far.
Am              Em
I\'d like to change my point of view
Am                 Em
I feel so lonely, I\'m waiting for you
Dm             Em           Am       [ Em ] ( Am )
But nothing ever happens - and I wonder.
[Chorus]

C             G
I wonder how, I wonder why
Am                              Em
Yesterday you told me \'bout the blue blue sky
F              G                    C           G7
And all that I can see is just a yellow lemon tree.
C               G
I\'m turning my head up and down,
Am                                  Em
I\'m turning turning turning turning turning around
F              F#dim                     G       G7
And all that I can see is just a yellow lemon tree.

[Verse]
Am             Em  
I\'m sitting here, I miss the power.
Am              Em
I\'d like to go out, taking a shower,
Am                    Em
But there\'s a heavy cloud inside my head.
Am                 Em
I feel so tired, put myself to bed,
Dm             Em           Am       [ Em ] ( Am )
Where nothing ever happens - and I wonder.
[Bridge]

E           Am
Isolation - Is not good for me,
G           C                       E
Isolation - I don\'t want to sit on a lemon tree.
[Verse]
Am                   Em
I\'m stepping around in a desert of joy
Am                     Em
Baby anyhow I\'ll get another toy
Dm             Em           Am       [ Em ] ( Am )
And everything will happen - and I will wonder.


[Chorus]

C             G
I wonder how, I wonder why
Am                              Em

G     D/F#    Em7
A long, long time ago,
Am            C                  Em                  D
I can still remember how that music used to make me smile
G      D/F#   Em7
And I knew if I had my chance,
Am                 C                Em              C            D
That I could make those people dance and maybe they\'d be happy for a while
Em       Am              Em                 Am
But February made me shiver, with every paper I\'d deliver
C        G      Am             C                     D
Bad news on the doorstep, I couldn\'t take one more step
G          D/F#     Em           Am7            D
I can\'t remember if I cried when I read about his widowed bride
G         D          Em
Something touched me deep inside
C      D7      G
The day the music died
[Chorus]
G    C        G        D
So bye, bye Miss American Pie
 G            C            G        D
Drove my Chevy to the levy but the levy was dry
 G        C                  G           D
And them good old boys were drinkin\' whiskey and rye
Em*                         A7*   Em*                         D7
Singin\' this will be the day that I die, this will be the day that I die

G                 Am
Did you write the book of love
C                 Am         Em           D
And do you have faith in god above, if the bible tells you so?
G      D/F#        Em
Do you believe in rock and roll
Am7            C              Em                 A7           D
Can music save your mortal soul and can you teach me how to dance real slow?
Em*                  D*                   Em*             D*
Well I know that you\'re in love with him \'cuz I saw you dancin\' in the gym
C           G        A7           C                    D7
You both kicked off your shoes, man I dig those rhythm and blues
G      D/F#     Em                   Am                   C
I was a lonely teenage broncin\' buck with a pink carnation and a pickup truck
G     D/F#    Em              C       D7    G  C  G
But I knew I was out of luck the day the music died, I started singin\'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie

 G                   Am
Now for ten years we\'ve been on our own,
C                   Am          Em                     D
and moss grows fat on a rolling stone but that\'s not how it used to be
  G     D/F#            Em
When the jester sang for the king and queen 
Am7                C                   Em             A7          D
in a coat he borrowed from James Dean in a voice that came from you and me
 Em*                 D*               Em*                 D*
Oh, and while the king was looking down, the jester stole his thorny crown
C        G          A7    C             D7
The courtroom was adjourned, no verdict was returned
  G         D/F#  Em             Am           C
And while Lennon read a book on Marx, the quartet practiced in the park
G        D/F#   Em             C         D7     G  C  G
And we sang dirges in the dark the day the music died, we were singin\'
[Chorus]
G    C        G        D
Bye, bye Miss American Pie
 G            C            G        D
Drove my Chevy to the levy but the levy was dry

Singin\' this will be the day that I die, this will be the day that I die
[Verse 4]
G                   Am
Helter skelter in a summer swelter
C                      Am                 Em                     D
the birds flew off with a fallout shelter, eight miles high and fallin\' fast
G   D/F#  Em
It landed foul on the grass
Am7                C            Em                             A7     D
the players tried for a forward pass, with the jester on the sidelines in a cast
 Em*               D*                  Em*                 D*
Now the half-time air was sweet perfume, while sergeants played a marching tune
C          G        A7      C                  D7
We all got up to dance, but we never got the chance
  G      D/F#      Em                 Am              C
\'Cuz the players tried to take the field, the marching band refused to yield
G    D/F#       Em              C        D7       G  C  G
Do you recall what was revealed the day the music died,    we started singin\'

Singin\' this will be the day that I die, this will be the day that I die
[Verse 5]
G                Am
And there we were all in one place,
C        Am            Em                   D
a generation lost in space, with no time left to start again
    G      D/F#   Em               Am7                 C
So come on Jack be nimble, Jack be quick, Jack Flash sat on a candle 
Em                   A7             D
stick, \'cuz fire is the devil\'s only friend
Em*              D*               Em*                    D*
And as I watched him on the stage, my hands were clenched in fists of rage
C      G       A7         C                  D7
No angel born in Hell could break that Satan\'s spell
   G            D/F#      Em             Am              C
And as the flames climbed high into the night to light the sacrificial rite
G   D/F#           Em           C      D7      G  C  G
I saw Satan laughing with delight the day the music died,     he was singin\'
[Chorus]

[Verse 6]
G    D/F#       Em
I met a girl who sang the blues
Am                 C               Em                      D
And I asked her for some happy news, but she just smiled and turned away
G       D/F#      Em
I went down to the sacred store
Am              C                     Em                 C
Where I\'d heard the music years before, but the man there said the music
 D
wouldn\'t play
Em*                Am*                    Em*                  Am*
But in the streets the children screamed, the lovers cried and the poets dreamed
C     G        Am          C                     D
But not a word was spoken, the church bells all were broken
G       D/F#   Em            Am7     C             D7
And the three men I admire most, the Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost
G             D/F#          Em               Am7     D7    G
They caught the last train for the coast the day the music died,
N.C.
And they were singin\'

[Verse]
Em
On a long and lonesome highway, east of Omaha
Dsus2
You can listen to the engine moanin\' out his one long song
Asus4                                                             Em
You can think about the woman or the girl you knew the night before
Em
But your thoughts will soon be wandering, the way they always do
Dsus2
When you\'re ridin\' sixteen hours and there\'s nothin\' much to do
Asus4                                                               Em
And you don\'t feel much like ridin\', you just wish the trip was through
[Chorus]

Here I am
Em
On the road again

There I am

Up on the stage

[Verse]
Em
So you walk into this restaurant, strung out from the road
Dsus2
And you feel the eyes upon you, as you\'re shakin\' off the cold
Asus4                                                        Em
You pretend it doesn\'t bother you, but you just want to explode
Em
Most times you can\'t hear them talk, other times you can
Dsus2
All the same old clich?s, Is it woman? is it man?
Asus4                                                    Em
And you always seem outnumbered, you don\'t dare make a stand
Em
Make your stand.
[Chorus]
Dsus2
Here I am

On the road again

Up on the stage

Out there in the spotlight, you\'re a million miles away
Dsus2
Every ounce of energy, you try to give away
Asus4                                                      Em
As the sweat pours out your body, like the music that you play
Em
Later in the evening, as you lie awake in bed
Dsus 2
With the echoes of the amplifiers ringin\' in your head
Asus4                                                    Em
You smoke the day\'s last cigarette, rememberin\' what she said

Oh, there\'s never been a woman who could

treat me like you do.
  Am                           Em
Who could trample on my pride and play around

Well, you really shake my mind up with your

cheating and your lies.

When you find your fascination in the arms of other guys.
 Am                          Em
You must know my reputation comes to nothing in their eyes.

Well, you take off in a hurry anytime it pleases you.

leaving you.

[Verse]

Am                C
No milk today, my love is gone away.
E                Am      E             Am
The bottle stands forlorn, a symbol of the dawn.
            C
No milk today, it seems a common sight,
E              Am       E               Am
But people passing by don\'t know the reason why.

A                        G
How could they know just what this message means,
D                               E      A
The end of all my hopes, the end of all my dreams,
                 G
How could they know, a palace there had been,
D                             E          A
behind the door where my love reigned as queen.
Am                C   
No milk today, it wasn\'t always so,
E           Am      E                 Am
The company was gay, we turn\'d night into day.
[Chorus]
A                E         D              E 
But all that\'s left is a place dark and lonely
A            E          D
A terraced house in a mean street back of town
A           E             D            E
Becomes a shrine when I think of you only
D               E
Just two up two down.
[Verse]
No milk today, it wasn\'t always so,
The company was gay, we turn\'d night into day.
As music played the faster did we dance
We felt it both at once, the start of our romance.
How could they know just what this message means,
The end of all my hopes, the end of all my dreams,
How could they know, a palace there had been,
behind the door where my love reigned as queen.
No milk today, my love is gone away.
The bottle stands forlorn, a symbol of the dawn.

`[Verse 1]
Can\'t stop, addicted to the shindig
Chop Top, he says I\'m gonna win big
Choose not a life of imitation
Distant cousin to the reservation
Defunkt, the pistol that you pay for
This punk, the feelin\' that you stay for
In time I want to be your best friend
East side love is living on the West End
Knocked out, but, boy, you better come to
Don\'t die, you know, the truth as some do
Go write your message on the pavement
Burn so bright, I wonder what the wave meant
White heat is screamin\' in the jungle
Complete the motion if you stumble
Go ask the dust for any answers
Come back strong with fifty belly dancers
[Chorus]
The world I love, the tears I drop
To be part of the wave, can\'t stop
Ever wonder if it\'s all for you?
The world I love, the trains I hop
To be part of the wave, can\'t stop
Come and tell me when it\'s time to
[Verse 2]
Sweetheart is bleeding in the snow cone
So smart, she\'s leadin\' me to ozone
Music, the great communicator
Use two sticks to make it in the nature
I\'ll get you into penetration
The gender of a generation
The birth of every other nation
Worth your weight, the gold of meditation
This chapter\'s gonna be a close one
Smoke rings, I know you\'re gonna blow one
All on a spaceship, persevering
Use my hands for everything but steering
Can\'t stop the spirits when they need you
Mop tops are happy when they feed you
J. Butterfly is in the treetop
Birds that blow the meaning into bebop
[Chorus]
The world I love, the tears I drop
To be part of the wave, can\'t stop
Ever wonder if it\'s all for you?
The world I love, the trains I hop
To be part of the wave, can\'t stop
Come and tell me when it\'s time to
[Bridge]
Wait a minute, I\'m passin\' out win or lose, just like you
Far more shockin\' than anything I ever knew, how about you?
Ten more reasons why I need somebody new, just like you
Far more shockin\' than anything I ever knew, right on cue
[Verse 3]
Can\'t stop, addicted to the shindig
Chop Top, he says I\'m gonna win big
Choose not a life of imitation
Distant cousin to the reservation
Defunct, the pistol that you pay for
This punk, the feelin\' that you stay for
In time I want to be your best friend
East side love is living on the West End
Knocked out, but boy, you better come to
Don\'t die, you know, the truth is some do
Go write your message on the pavement
Burn so bright, I wonder what the wave meant
Kick start the golden generator
Sweet talk but don\'t intimidate her
Can\'t stop the gods from engineering
Feel no need for any interfering
Your image in the dictionary
This life is more than ordinary
Can I get two, maybe even three of these?
Comin\' from the space to teach you of the Pleiades
Can\'t stop the spirits when they need you
This life is more than just a read-through`		})

Em                            C     Am
Have you got colour in your cheeks?
Am                                        Em  
Do you ever get the fear that you can\'t shift the type
                 Em 
that sticks around like summat in your teeth?
        C             Am
Are there some aces up your sleeve?
                         Em
Have you no idea that you\'re in deep?
                   Em
I dreamt about you nearly every night this week
  C             Am
How many secrets can you keep?
                            Em
Cause there\'s this tune I found that makes me think of you somehow
Em 
And I play it on repeat
C         Am
Until I fall asleep
               B
Spilling drinks on my settee
[Pre-Chorus]
C
Do I wanna know
 Am
if this feeling flows both ways?
Em
Sad to see you go
  Em
Was sorta hoping that you\'d stay
C 
Baby we both know
  Am
That the nights were mainly made
     Em                               Em
for saying things that you can\'t say tomorrow day
[Chorus]
          Em
Crawlin\' back to you
        C       Am
Ever thought of calling when you\'ve had a few
     Em
Cos I always do
  Em             C         Am
Maybe I\'m too busy being yours to fall for somebody new
             Em
Now I\'ve thought it through
          Em
Crawlin\' back to you
[Verse]
            C    Am
So have you got the guts?
                            Em
Been wondering if your hearts still open
           Em
And if so I wanna know what time it shuts
C              Am
Simmer down and pucker up
I\'m sorry to interrupt
Em
It\'s just I\'m constantly on the cusp
     C        Am
Of trying to kiss you
                      Em
I don\'t know if you feel the same as I do
       C        Am               
But we could be together
      B
if you wanted to
[Pre-Chorus]
C
Do I wanna know
 Am
if this feeling flows both ways?
Em
Sad to see you go
  Em
Was sorta hoping that you\'d stay

Baby we both know

And if I catch it coming back my way
       Em            G       C    B
I\'m gonna serve it to you
  Em            G C B          
And that ain\'t what you want to hear
       Em            G       C    B
But that\'s what I\'ll do
Am (actually G)        B (actually A)
And a feeling coming from my bones says find a home 
[Verse 3]
  Em            G C B      
I\'m going to Wichita
       Em            G       C    B
Far from this opera, forever more
  Em            G C B      
I\'m going to work the straw
       Em            G       C    B
Make the sweat drip out of every pore
  Em            G C B      
And I\'m bleeding and I\'m bleeding and I\'m bleeding
       Em            G       C    B
Right before the Lord
  Em            G C B      
All the words are going to bleed from me
       Em            G       C    B
And I will think no more
Am (actually G)        B (actually A)   
And the stains coming from my blood tell me go back home`		})

C     G               Am    F
Well, someone told me yesterday

that when you throw your love away
C   G             Am         F
you act as if you just don´t care,
C   G                 Am        F
you look as if you´re going somewhere.
C   G               Am      F
But I just can´t convince myself,
C G                  Am    F
I couldn´t live with noone else
C   G          Am        F
and I can only play that part
C   G                Am     F
and sit and nurse my broken heart. So lonely!

Now noone´s knocked upon my door
C     G                 Am    F
for a thousand years or maybe more.
C   G             Am       F
All made up and nowhere to go,
C G               Am      F
welcome to this one man show.
C    G                    Am     F
Just take a seat, they´re always free,
C G               Am   F
no surprise, no mystery.
C       G              Am      F
In this theatre that I call my soul

Em C G D/F#  4x
[Verse 1]
Em       C                G                D/F# 
Another head hangs lowly, child is slowly taken
Em               C                    G               D/F# 
And the violence caused such silence, who are we mistaken 
Em                        C 
But you see it\'s not me, it\'s not my family
G                               D/F# 
In your head, in your head, they are fighting 
   Em                              C                                                         
With their tanks and their bombs and their bombs and their guns 
 G                             D/F#
in your head, in your head, they are crying
[Chorus 1]
Em            C            G             D/F# 
In your head, in your head, zombie, zombie, zombie 
       Em            C            G             D/F# 
What\'s in your head, in your head, zombie, zombie, zombie 
Em C G D/F# x2
[Verse 2]
Em        C                  G              D/F# 
Another mother\'s breaking heart is taking over
Em                C               G            D/F# 
When the violence causes silence, we must be mistaken
 Em                   C  
It\'s the same old theme since 1916
G                                  D/F# 
In your head, in your head, they\'re still fighting
   Em                              C  
With their tanks and their bombs and their bombs and their guns
G                            D/F# 
In your head, in your head, they\'re dying
[Chorus 2]
Em            C            G             D/F# 
In your head, in your head, zombie, zombie, zombie 
       Em            C            G             D/F# 
What\'s in your head, in your head, zombie, zombie, zombie

They\'re tryin\' to track me down;
Eb             Dm7                 Gm
They say they want to bring me in guilty,
Eb           Dm7  Gm

And they say it is a capital offence. Yeah!

Eb       Dm7               Gm
Sheriff John Brown always hated me,
Eb     Dm7      Gm
For what... I don\'t know.
Eb     Dm7     Gm
Every time I plant a seed,
Eb         Dm7     Gm

Freedom came my way one day,

And I started, out of town, yeah!

There’s a lady who’s sure

And she’s buying a stairway to heaven.

If the stores are all closed

With a word she can get what she came for.

In a tree by the brook

There’s a songbird who sings,

Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven.

There’s a feeling I get

When I look to the west,
C         G          F   Am
And my spirit is crying for leaving.
C               G
In my thoughts I have seen

Rings of smoke through the trees,

And the voices of those who stand looking.

If we all call the tune

Then the piper will lead us to reason.

And a new day will dawn

Don’t be alarmed now,

It’s just a spring clean for the may queen.

Yes, there are two paths you can go by

The pipers calling you to join him,

Our shadows taller than our soul.

There walks a lady we all know

Who shines white light and wants to show

How everything still turns to gold.

And if you listen very hard
      G              F   GAm
The tune will come to you at last.
     G              F  GAm
When all are one and one is all
G               F
To be a rock and not to roll.

    C                D
We\'re going out on our first date
    Em                     Am
But you and me are thrifty so go all you can eat
     C                   D
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
    Em                          Am
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
     C                D
And how your family is doin\' okay
      Em                 Am
And leave and get in a taxi, we kiss in the backseat
 C                     D
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I\'m singing like
[Pre-Chorus]
Em                Am
Girl, you know I want your love
C                      D                 Em
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
      Am
Come on now, follow my lead
C               D    
I may be crazy, don\'t mind me, say
Em                 Am
Boy, let\'s not talk too much
C                    D                Em
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
      Am
Come on now, follow my lead
C                           D
Come—come on now, follow my lead
[Chorus]
Em        Am                   C
I\'m in love with the shape of you
    D                  Em
We push and pull like a magnet do
    Am              C
Although my heart is falling too
D 
I\'m in love with your body
Em           Am                 C
And last night you were in my room
   D                    Em
And now my bedsheets smell like you
          Am                  C
Every day discovering something brand new
    D
Well I\'m in love with your body
Em         Am         C   D
Oh, Oh I, Oh I, Oh I,   I\'m in love with your body
Em         Am         C   D
Oh, Oh I, Oh I, Oh I,   I\'m in love with your body
Em         Am         C   D
Oh, Oh I, Oh I, Oh I,   I\'m in love with your body
Em             Am                     C  
Every day discovering something brand new
D
I\'m in love with the shape of you
[Bridge]
Em               Am
Come on, be my baby, come on
C               D
Come on, be my baby, come on
Em               Am
Come on, be my baby, come on
C               D
Come on, be my baby, come on
Em               Am
Come on, be my baby, come on
C               D
Come on, be my baby, come on
Em               Am
Come on, be my baby, come on
C               D
Come on, be my baby, come on
[Chorus]
Em         Am                   C
I\'m in love with the shape of you
  D                     Em
We push and pull like a magnet do
    Am                C
Although my heart is falling too
D 
I\'m in love with your body
Em          Am                  C
And last night you were in my room
   D                    Em
And now my bedsheets smell like you

Come on, be my baby, come on
C                D               Em
Come on, I\'m in love with your body
Am     C            D               Em
Ooh, now, well I\'m in love with your body
Am       C                 D
Ooh, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
    Em         Am     C
With your body
    D                        Em
Well I\'m in love with the shape of you`		})

`[Verse 1]
Am                        G
Hello darkness, my old friend,
                   Am
I\'ve come to talk with you again,
             F       C
Because a vision softly creeping,
               F       C
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
F                             C
And the vision that was planted in my brain
    C    Am
Still remains
C           G        Am
Within the sound of silence.
[Verse 2]
                G
In restless dreams I walked alone
                Am
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
           F        C
\'neath the halo of a street lamp,
                  F        C
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
F                                        C
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
            C    Am
That split the night
C              G        Am
And touched the sound of silence.
[Verse 3]
                 G
And in the naked light I saw
                   Am
Ten thousand people, maybe more.
           F       C
People talking without speaking,
           F        C
People hearing without listening,
       F                       C
People writing songs that voices never share
      C    Am
And no one dare
C           G        Am
Disturb the sound of silence.
[Verse 4]
                 G
Fools said I, you do not know
              Am
Silence like a cancer grows.
             F           C
Hear my words that I might teach you,
            F           C
Take my arms that I might reach you.
F                           C       Am 
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
C
And echoed
G        Am
In the wells of silence
[Verse 5]
                 G
And the people bowed and prayed
             Am
To the neon God they made.
                 F      C
And the sign flashed out its warning,
              F     C
In the words that it was forming.
               F
And the sign said, the words of the prophets
                   C
Are written on the subway walls
     C         Am
And tenement halls.
 C           G         Am
And whisper\'d in the sounds of silence.`		})

You poor old sod you see it\'s only me

And you snatch your rattling last breathes with deep-sea-diver-sounds

And the flowers bloomed like madness in the spring

[Verse 1]
 Bm                 A
Baby, do you understand me now
G                           F#
  Sometimes I feel a little mad
      Bm                                   A 
Well don\'t you know that no-one alive can always be an angel
G                                   F#
  When things go wrong I seem to be bad
[Chorus]
D                      Bm                  A
I\'m just a soul who\'s intentions are good
G           [N.C.]                     Bm
Oh Lord   please don\'t let me be misunderstood
Bm                     Em
[Verse 2]
 Bm                 A
Baby, sometimes I\'m so carefree
G                           F#
With a joy that\'s hard to hide
      Bm                                   A 
And sometimes it seems that all I have to do is worry
G                                   F#
And then you\'re bound to see my other side
[Chorus]
D                      Bm                  A
I\'m just a soul who\'s intentions are good
G           [N.C.]                     Bm
Oh Lord   please don\'t let me be misunderstood
Bm                     Em
[Bridge]
Bm    A  [first 3 beats as per intro]
/ / / /
G            A       G           A
  If I seem edgy, I want you to know
 G            A               D     Bm/F#
That I never mean to take it out on you
G                 A             G       A
  Life has it\'s problems and I get my share
     G                        F#
And that\'s one thing I never mean to do, \'cause I love you
Verse 3:
 Bm                 A
Oh, oh, oh, baby, don\'t you know I\'m human
G                           F#
Have thoughts like any other one
Bm                                   A 
Sometimes I find myself long regretting
G                                   F#
Some foolish thing, some little simple thing I\'ve done
[Chorus]
D                      Bm                  A
I\'m just a soul who\'s intentions are good
G           [N.C.]                     Bm
Oh Lord   please don\'t let me be misunderstood
Bm                     Em            (fade)

where no diamond can save your mortal soul?

I grant you, lonesome new stories,

I don\'t care, blinded by dollars,

So let me free from your prison,

Like a ring gone down the drain
Our love in sunlight, at evening, pain
Like vermin Roman sewers bring
Pain and love, oh yeah, are The Same Thing
Are The Same Thing ...
In my opinion, we are the red birth mark
From the old storybook, "Equal Light, Equal Dark"
Now lets flip a coin to see now who\'s yin and who is yang
It defies opinion whether they\'re The Same Thing
Nothing in common; our blood, thicker than broth
We\'re cut from different sides of the same cloth
Our love in sunlight, our pain at evening
Have nothing in common, yet they\'re both The Same Thing
The same street, the same address
The same white hair, the same black dress
The sameness from opposites cling
Pain and Love, oh yeah, are The Same Thing
Are The Same Thing ...
In my opinion, a line is never crossed
Until now, I was my inner feelings were always lost
Through spirit or season, does the human voice does sing?
Death and opinion they are The Same Thing
Nothing in common; our blood, thicker than broth
We\'re cut from different sides of the same cloth
Our love in sunlight, our pain at evening

Whoa oh oh oh oh
D                 G                               D

Whoa oh oh oh oh
D                    G                             D
All that you would have me do is cross that county line

C#m    |G# C#m
[Verse]
E                         C#m
To the town of Agua Fria rode a stranger one fine day
E                                                 C#m
Hardly spoke to folks around him, didn\'t have too much to say
A                                E
No one dared to ask his business, no one dared to make a slip
                                   C#m
For the stranger there amongst them had a big iron on his hip
A               E
Big iron on his hip
E                         C#m
It was early in the morning when he rode into the town
 E                                             C#m
He came riding from the south side slowly lookin\' all around
 A                                 E
He\'s an outlaw loose and running came the whisper from each lip
                                    C#m
And he\'s here to do some business with the big iron on his hip
A               E
big iron on his hip
 E                                C#m
In this town there lived an outlaw by the name of Texas Red
E                                                C#m
Many men had tried to take him and that many men were dead
A                             E
He was vicious and a killer though a youth of twenty-four
                                C#m
And the notches on his pistol numbered one an nineteen more
A                E
One and nineteen more
 E                            C#m
Now the stranger started talking, made it plain to folks around
E                                      C#m
Was an Arizona ranger, wouldn\'t be too long in town
 A                           E
He came here to take an outlaw back alive or maybe dead
                             C#m
And he said it didn\'t matter, he was after Texas Red
A           E
After Texas Red
 E                          C#m
Wasn\'t long before the story was relayed to Texas Red
 E                                              C#m
But the outlaw didn\'t worry, men that tried before were dead
A                            E
Twenty men had tried to take him, twenty men had made a slip
                                 C#m
Twenty-one would be the ranger with the big iron on his hip
A               E
Big iron on his hip
E                                C#m
The morning passed so quickly, it was time for them to meet
E                                              C#m
It was twenty past eleven when they walked out in the street
    A                                 E
Folks were watching from their windows, every body held their breath
                            C#m
They knew this handsome ranger was about to meet his death
A                 E
About to meet his death
   E                                 C#m
There was forty feet between them when they stopped to make their play
 E                                                C#m
And the swiftness of the ranger is still talked about today
A                                  E
Texas Red had not cleared leather for a bullet fairly ripped
                                 C#m
And the rangers aim was deadly with the big iron on his hip
A               E
Big iron on his hip
E                         C#m
It was over in a moment and the folks had gathered round
E                                             C#m
There before them lay the body of the outlaw on the ground
A                                E
Oh he might have gone on living but he made one fatal slip
                                    C#m
When he tried to match the ranger with the big iron on his hip
A               E
Big iron on his hip
C#m        E
Big iron, Big iron
 E                                  C#m
When he tried to match the ranger with the big iron on his hip
A               E
Big iron on his hip

[Intro]
Bm
[Verse 1]
D                               Bm
When I was but a young man I was wild and full of fire
D                                   Bm
A youth within my teens, but full of challenge and desire
D                               Bm
I ran away from home and left my mother and my dad
G                    A               Bm
I know it grieved them so to think their only boy was bad.
[Verse 2]
D                                  Bm
I fell in with an outlaw band, their names were known quite well
D                                    Bm
How many times we robbed and plundered, I could never tell
D                    Bm
This kind of sinful living leads only to a fall
G                   A               Bm
I learned that much and more the night I heard my Master call.
[Pre-chorus]
G                   D           G             D
One night we rustled cattle, a thousand head or so
G                    D                 Bm
And started them out on the trail that leads to Mexico
G                  A       D                  G
But a norther started blowing and lightning flashed about
D            G            A                  D
I thought someone was calling me, I thought I heard a shout.
[Chorus]
D                              F#m                      
Then at that moment lightning struck not twenty yards from me
G                                      D
And left there was a giant cross where once there was a tree
 Bm                               Em
And this time I knew I heard a voice, a voice so sweet and strange
      F#m                    Bm
A voice that came from everywhere, a voice that called my name.
[Verse 3]
D                               Bm
So frightened I was thinking of sinful deeds I\'d done
D                                     Bm
I failed to see the thousand head of cattle start to run
D                                  Bm
The cattle they stampeded, were running all around
G              A               Bm
My pony ran but stumbled and it threw me to the ground.

[Pre-chorus]
G                 D          G                D         
I felt the end was near, that death would be the price
G                     D                   Bm
When a mighty bolt of lightning showed the face of Jesus Christ
G                   A               D            G
And I cried oh Lord forgive me, don\'t let it happen now
D                     G          A                D
I want to live for you alone, Oh God these words I vow.
[Chorus]
D                          F#m                
My wicked past unfolded, I thought of wasted years
G                                   D
When another bolt of lightning killed a hundred head of steers
  Bm                              Em    
And the others rushed on by me and I was left to live
F#m                        Bm
The Master had a reason, life is his to take or give.
[Verse 4]
D                                    Bm
A miracle performed that night, I wasn\'t meant to die
D                                 Bm
The dead ones formed a barricade least six or seven high
D                           Bm           
And right behind it there was I, afraid but safe and sound
G                  A              Bm   
I cried and begged for mercy kneeling there upon the ground.
[Verse 5]
D                       Bm
A pardon I was granted, my sinful soul set free
D                                Bm
No more to fear the angry waves upon life\'s stormy sea
D                           Bm
Forgiven by the love of God, a love that will remain
G               A                 Bm      Bm7       Bm
I gave my life and soul the night the Saviour called my name..`		})

C C C F F F
In tribute to all things petite
Pretty and sweet
This verse I offer and greet
In desire to replete
A portrait painted from truth
But imagined to soothe
For Beauty, eternal in youth
Loves pity, compassion, and ruth
I stumbled out of the saloon
An evening last June
And heard a distant, mournful tune
Under the dyad moon
My Soul, though with wine I did douse
The song did arouse
I followed, a drunken louse
Unto a cardboard house
And through the window to see
A doll before me
Singing to the mirror was she-
Was it a plea?
Her room was all dresses and bows
For a doll needs her clothes
She leaned in to breathe from a rose
And stood on her tippy-toes
With a brush made of jade and pearl
She straightened her blonde curl
I saw the sad eyes of a girl
Under teardrops, aswirl
She went to her canopied bed
And laid down her head
She picked up her sheep-doll and said
Something with dread
Though I was too drunk to make sense
I felt her Essence
And turned to leave this pretense
For night, black and immense
I remember that singing doll
And her grievous call
As a little reminder to us all
Whose sadness wasn’t so small
                                        `		})

D                   C                 G   
It\'s all the same , only the names will change
C         G       F                  D  
And ev\'ry day , it seems we\'re wasting away
D               C                      G
Another place , where the faces are so cold
C             G            F           D
I\'d drive all night , just to get back home
[Chorus]
C        G        F               D                    
I\'m a cowboy , on a steel horse I ride
C         G  F       D 
I\'m wanted , dead or alive
C     G  F       D
Wanted , dead or alive
[Verse]
D                   C                   G 
Sometimes I sleep , sometimes is not for days
C             G           F                  D
and people I meet , always go their separate ways
D                            C                     G
Sometimes you tell the day , by the bottle that you drink
C                    G           F             D
And times when you´r alone , and all you do is think
[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
F     G                Am
The white dog of the farm still breeds
C
She\'s off her leash
F
To tear flesh and teach
G        Am    C  F 
Bum bum bum
[Verse 2]
G                     Am
You think you\'ve heard it all before
C
Well, here\'s once more
F
We\'re all at war
G         Am    C  F
Bum bum bum
[Verse 3]
G                   Am
Blood in the streets, our eternal river
C
I know the killer
F
He counts my silver
G         Am   C  F 
Bum bum bum
[Verse 4]
G               Am
They ambushed them behind the reeds
C
These are our seeds
F
White dog still breeds
G         Am   C  F
Bum bum bum
[Bridge 1]
G Am C  F  G  Am  C
G7
They say, “Buy when there\'s blood in the streets
G7
Even if the blood is your own”
   G7
So they employed men far away
G7
To turn against their home
Bb 
Centuries in the distant mist
Am              D    Dsus2 Dm D F
But it\'s not a dream
[Verse 5]
G                    Am
No, it ain\'t no dream, it\'s all too real
C 
How long until
      F
This river of blood congeals?
G        Am   C  F
Bum bum bum
[Verse 6]
G               Am
And eulogies poured from the stage
C
But nothing changed
F
The dog was caged
G        Am      C  F
Bum bum bum
[Verse 7]                      
G                              Am
And white bread artists won\'t even look at you
  C
When they know it\'s true
  F
What you gonna do?
G         Am   C F 
Bum bum bum
[Bridge 2]
G7
Thought I heard some woman screaming
G7
And I sat up in my bed
G7
And I went over to the window
G7
And I saw him in the cold street, lying dead
Bb
Oh, please tell me, you academics
Am                           D         Dsus2   Dm Dsus4 F
How do you wake up from a non-dream?
[Verse 8]
G                    Am
No, it ain\'t no dream, it’s all too real
C
How long until
      F
This river of blood congeals?
G         Am    C F 
Bum bum bum
[Verse 9]
G            Am
Sent a letter to my congressman
C 
The Ku Klux Klan
F
From my pierced hands
G         Am     C  F
Bum bum bum
[Verse 10]
G               Am
They sent me back an Apple phone
C
A fine-hair comb
F
And a bell tolled
G         Am   C  F
Bum bum bum
[Verse 11]
G                       Am
The phone rang once and the line went dead
C
All blood runs red
F
White pups still bred
G         Am    C   F   G
Bum bum bum

You can\'t say we\'re satisfied

Angie, you\'re beautiful, but ain\'t it time we said good-bye?
Angie, I still love you, remember all those nights we cried?
All the dreams we held so close seemed to all go up in smoke
Let me whisper in your ear:
Angie, Angie, where will it lead us from here?
Oh, Angie, don\'t you weep, all your kisses still taste sweet
I hate that sadness in your eyes
But Angie, Angie, ain\'t it time we said good-bye?
With no loving in our souls and no money in our coats
You can\'t say we\'re satisfied
But Angie, I still love you, baby
Ev\'rywhere I look I see your eyes
There ain\'t a woman that comes close to you
Come on Baby, dry your eyes

I am so lonely, I\'m Mr. Lonely

Capo 5 and same chords
Letters, never a letter
I get no letters in the mail
I\'ve been forgotten, yes, forgotten
Oh how I wonder, how is it I failed

Now I\'m a soldier, a lonely soldier
