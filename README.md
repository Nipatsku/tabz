## Automated tests

Unit tests are compiled from TypeScript files (test/), ran with *Mocha*, using *chai* as assertion library.

Run tests with "npm run test"


## Issues

**Ejected** create-react-app because "baseUrl" compilerOption is not supported in version 2. Updating to version 3 would require changing from tslint to eslint. Not a problem, but I like having full control over the linting process (gulp).
