## Automated tests

Unit tests are compiled from TypeScript files (test/), ran with *Mocha*, using *chai* as assertion library.

Run tests with "npm run test"

## Absolute imports

Not working with create-react-app 2
Don't want to upgrade to version 3, because it enforces eslint with no way of overriding rules. Sticking to shitty relative imports instead.
